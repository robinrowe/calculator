    This program implements a basic expression calculator.
    Input from cin; output to cout.

    The grammar for input is:

    Calculation:
        Statement
        Print
        Quit
        Calculation Statement

    Statement:
        Declaration
        Expression

    Declaration:
        "let" Name "=" Expression
        "const" Name "=" Expression

    Print:
        ;

    Quit:
        q

    Expression:
        Term
        Expression + Term
        Expression - Term
    Term:
        Primary
        Term * Primary
        Term / Primary
        Term % Primary
    Primary:
        Number
        Name
        Name = Expression
        ( Expression )
        - Primary
        + Primary
    Number:
        floating-point-literal
    Name:
        [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z_0-9]*	// a letter followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits
                                // note that I decided not to start a namewith an underscore
                                // just because I consider it ugly)
